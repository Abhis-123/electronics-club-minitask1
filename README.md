# MINI TASK - 1

## 1. KEYBOARD USING SMD SENSORS:

In this project, a small keyboard is made using cardboard. The cardboard is cut into various small pieces which corresponds to various keys in the keyboard. The various pieces are joined using hot silicone. There are 5 keys which correspond to C,D,E,F,G frequencies and is fitted into a larger cardboard using rubber straps, and there are slots made for inserting them onto the base. SMD sensors are used to detect which key is being pressed, and is therefore fitted below each key of the keyboard. The sensors are connected to 5 analog pins of an Ardunio Mega and is coded using the toneAC library such that sound of the corresponding frequency comes when that particular key is pressed. In this way, this project was implemented.
